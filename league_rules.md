        2. A Banished Owner may not participate in the Mond League group chat.
3. Roster Construction
    1. Each Squad is obligated to roster 8 QBs in between the end of the Rookie/FA Draft and the following season’s Release Window. 
    2. Trades:
        1. Squads may make (a) Asset for Asset trades during the period between the Super Bowl and the end of the Rookie/FA Draft; and (b) QB for QB trades during the period between the end of the Rookie FA/Draft and the beginning of the NFL Regular Season.
        2. An Asset for Asset trade may only be made official if each trading Squad is trading the same aggregate number of combined QBs and draft picks (“Assets”) (no more and no less).
            1. Example: one Squad may trade one draft pick and Matt Ryan to a second Squad for two draft picks (2 Assets traded on each side). HOWEVER, one Squad may NOT trade Matt Ryan and one draft pick to a second Squad in exchange for one draft pick (2 Assets on one side, 1 Asset on the other side)
        3. A QB for QB trade may only be made official if each trading Squad is trading the same number of rostered QBs.
        4. Trade Vetos
            1. An otherwise official trade may be vetoed by the Owners of all non-trading Squads if all such Owners unanimously agree that the trade is unfair (for whatever reason).
4. Release Window
    1. Each Squad is obligated to release at least 2 QBs (“Mandatory Release Amount”) during the Saturday/Sunday/Monday following Day 2 of the NFL Draft (the “Release Window”). 
    2. Squads may drop more QBs than the Mandatory Release Amount. There is no maximum.
        1. The Release Window shall end upon the commencement of the Rookie/FA Draft.
    3. Any Squad’s failure to comply with the Mandatory Release Amount will result in the automatic release of such Squad’s lowest scoring QB(s) from the previous season until such Squad satisfies the Mandatory Release Amount. 
        1. If multiple QBs are tied as a Squad’s the lowest scoring QB subject to automatic release, the majority of the remaining 5 Owners shall vote to determine which of the tied QBs will be automatically released.
5. Rookie/FA Draft
    1. The Rookie/FA Draft will be commence at 10:00 a.m. ET on the Monday following the NFL Draft.
    2. Draft Process:
        1. Owners will have 8 hours to make a selection (“Turn”) via the League group chat. 
        2. An Owner’s Turn begins as soon as the previous Turn ends.
        3. A draft selection is deemed “Made” (and the Turn is ended) when the Owner whose Turn it is texts the name (or other identifiable characteristic) of a Draft Eligible QB to the League group chat.
            1. An Owner may not rescind a draft selection once it is Made without the unanimous consent of all remaining Owners.
            2. If it there is a genuine dispute as to whether a draft selection was Made, the Rookie/FA Draft will be paused indefinitely and the remaining Owners will determine by majority vote whether or not the draft selection was Made.
        4. If a Squad fails to make a selection during its Turn, it shall be deemed to have automatically traded its draft slot with the Squad who holds the immediately following draft slot. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no dispute resolution process pursuant to this Rule 5.2.4 and there is no grace period.
        5. Owners may prospectively request timing extensions for their Turn before their Turn ends. 
            1. Such request must state the length of the requested extension.
            2. If at least 50% of the non-requesting Owners approve such request, the requested extension will be granted. If less than 50% of the non-requesting Owners approve such request, the request will be denied.
            3. Non-requesting Owners will have, from the time the request is sent to the group chat, 1 hour to vote whether or not to approve such request, and, upon the expiration of that 1 hour, the votes that have been cast will be tallied and the request will be deemed granted or denied.
    3. Draft Pool:
        1. Any QB who has ever declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft is eligible to be selected in the Rookie/FA Draft (“Draft Eligible”).
            1. For the avoidance of doubt, QBs released during the Release Window are Draft Eligible.
            2. For the avoidance of doubt, a Squad is permitted to select a QB during the Rookie/FA Draft that it released during any previous Release Window.
    4. Opening Rounds:
        1. The draft order of the two Opening Rounds shall be the reverse order of previous season’s standings. This is NOT a snake-style Draft.
        2. Each team will have a selection in each Opening Round (barring trades).
    5. Additional Round:
        1. The Additional Round will directly follow the end of the Opening Rounds.
        2. Squads that release a number of QBs greater than the Mandatory Release Amount will be awarded a number of Additional Round draft picks that is equal to the number of QBs released by such Squad minus the Mandatory Release Amount. The lowest scoring QB(s) (from the previous season) amongst those released by each squad shall be deemed released for purposes of satisfying the Mandatory Release Amount. If a squad releases a number of QBs in excess of the Mandatory Release Amount then the QBs who scored the most points (from the previous) shall be used for determining the Additional Round draft order pursuant to Rule 5.4 below.
            1. Example: In 2023, if a Squad releases 4 QBs during the Release Window, it will have two draft picks in the Additional Round. If those 3 QBs released by such Squad scored 50, 30, 15 and 10 points, respectively, then the QBs who scored 50 and 30 points shall be used for purposes of determining Additional Round Draft Order, per Rule 5.4.
        3. Squads that merely meet, but do not exceed, the Mandatory Release Amount will not have any draft picks in the Additional Rounds.
        4. Additional Round Draft Order:
            1. The Draft Order in the additional round shall be set in descending order of the number of points of the released QBs.
